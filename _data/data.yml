      - role: Research Assistent
        time: Nov. 2023 - Current
        company: Artificial Intelligence Institute of Seoul National University (AIIS)
        details: |
          As a research assistant, I'm actively engaged in a project focused on human-level evaluation of Large Language Models (LLMs). My responsibilities include designing and implementing a pragmatic evaluation framework, analyzing LLM performance, and contributing to the development of more context-aware modeling. In close collaboration with a team of researchers and professors, I contribute to research discussions and idea generation.
      
      - role: Undergraduate Researcher
        time: Aug. 2020 - July. 2021
        company: Natural Language Processing Lab, Konkuk University
        details: |
          In my role as an undergraduate researcher, I was intensively involved in Machine Translation (MT) and its evaluation, specifically focusing on enhancing the performance of MT systems for the English-Korean language pair. My work involved modeling Transformer-based MT systems and evaluating their performance using the BLEU metric for automatic assessment and Grammar Accuracy Evaluation (GAE), a novel evaluation framework I developed that focuses on grammatical correctness.

    intro: |
      My research interests lie in the application of machine learning and deep learning techniques to natural language processing, with a specific focus on machine translation. In the works listed below, I've explored methods for improving German phoneme recognition using text-to-phoneme data augmentation, proposed a qualitative method for evaluating the grammar accuracy of machine translation models, and investigated the use of multiple tokenization strategies in Korean-English machine translation. These publications represent my ongoing commitment to improving machine understanding of human languages, with the ultimate goal of creating more accurate and effective translation tools.
